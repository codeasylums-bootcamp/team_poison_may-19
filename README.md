Auto fill Booking Portal - IRCTC etc.

IDEA: The idea is to automate the IRCTC booking process based on the inputs given by the user. This project consists of Python Script which takes the inputs from the website stored in Database. The finding trains form is autofilled and the train is identified by its number,source,destination and date. The username and password are also filled automatically. This leads to the passenger details whcih are fetched from the database and auto filled. The entire process finally leads to the Banking step wherein the user has to give his/her details.

STATUS: Login and Authentication to the website is done. Python script is half done and is tested using an arbitrary input. Backend linking the front-end and python script is pending.

NOTE: To test the Python script, use Jupyter notebook with selenium installed and to run the web page. 
1) type "export FLASK_APP=first.py"
2) then type "flask run" in terminal.

FRONTEND: HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP
FRAMEWORKS USED: FLASK, SELENIUM
DATABASE USED: SQLITE
BACKEND ENVIRONMENT: Python
